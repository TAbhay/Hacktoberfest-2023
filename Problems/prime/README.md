# Prime Number Checker

This C++ program checks if a given integer is a prime number.

## Code Explanation
The code consists of two main parts:

The isprime function checks whether a number is prime or not.

The main function takes user input, calls the isprime function, and prints whether the input number is prime or not.

Example:

Enter the Number: 17

The Number 17 is Prime

## Notes
Prime numbers are defined as positive integers greater than 1.

This code is suitable for checking small numbers. For very large numbers, more optimized algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, are recommended.
